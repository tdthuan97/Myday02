Your mission
Your mission is to write a mini sed. 

The parameters will always be well formatted, and we won't test undefined behaviors such as 'y/ooo/abc/' or 'y/abc/bcd/'.

Your function must be named sed and in a file named sed.py.

Signature

def sed(command, s):
    """Apply a sed command to a string.

    Two commands are supported:
        - s/pattern/replacement/g
        - y/string1/string2/

    This sed is a simple version: in our case, `pattern` is a string, not a
    regular expression.

    -----

    The first command replaces `pattern` with `replacement`. Any character
    other than `\` or `\n` can replace `/`.

        >>> sed('s/morning/evening/g', 'Good morning')
        'Good evening'
        >>> sed('s👍morning👍evening👍g', 'Good morning')
        'Good evening'
        >>> sed('s/afternoon/evening/g', 'Good afternoon.\\nWhat an afternoon')
        'Good evening.\\nWhat an evening'

    Be careful, sed is applied line by line, so `hello\nworld` is not a good
    pattern.

    -----

    The second command replaces all characters from `string1` with characters
    from `string2`. This means that len(string1) == len(string2).

    Any character other than `\` or `\n` can replace `/`.

        >>> sed('y/aeo/430/', 'hello mr wayne')
        'h3ll0 mr w4yn3'
    """
